# Microphone Audio Project

The Microphone Audio Project is a Python project that connects to your microphone and visualizes audio data in the terminal. This project allows you to view audio data as a raw signal or as a translated graph using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The project also uses plotext to display the audio graph in the terminal.

### Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine to get started with your audio data.

### Prerequisites

To use this project, you should have Python 3.x installed on your local machine.


### Usage

To use the Microphone Audio Project, you need to have a microphone connected to your machine. You can start by running the microphone_audio.py script. This will prompt you to select an audio mode (raw or FFT) and then display the audio graph in the terminal.

The audio_raw.py and audio_fft.py scripts show how to connect to the microphone and display the raw or FFT audio data respectively.
